		Gaming In China

	Video games are heavily biased in China. The conversation above has happened over count-less families, including the author’s.

<div id="i2">
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is also a legislative regulation in place that blocks games or media from coming into the Great Fire Wall of China. A censorship system is in place so that for games to be published in China, foreign or local publisher will have to file a profile to the government agency with constantly shifting criteria due to domestic circumstances. A particular game or film could take up to 10 years to pass the bar and be available to public, given that if they can pass at all with the ever changing rules.</p> 
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is so to say, without some “illegal borrowing”, players in China could not get access to the most up-to-date games.</p> 
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe situation went better when online platforms like Epic Games, Steam, Origin, or Ubisoft entered China a few years ago, they brought some power balance into China. The platforms were International Megacrops who were powerful enough to be considered gray areas which were publishing games, bypassing the censorship system.</p> 

	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHowever, by 2020, the government strengthened their grasp and finally pressured the corps to develop a special “Chinese-edition” for China-region IP users which omitted 40% of the game from the official branch.</p>

		To make it worse, the few domestic Tech Megacorps like Bytedance, Netease and Tencent has been actively stirring the water for indie developers. They have been reported by developers to be stealing assets or ideas from indies and even plagiarizing leaked source codes. With the corp’s wealth, they didn’t have to win lawsuits, they just have to last the session long enough to bankrupt the indie studios.

	<div id="i32">
		While some concerns by the parents on video games are certainly based. A scorched earth approach to all games are not rational. Games can be addicting, but they can also be beautiful. The thing to blame for distraction and addiction has been changing with the time. Video games are just collateral of the age. It was light novels 10 years ago, and it was the cicada flying outside of the classroom’s window 30 years ago.
